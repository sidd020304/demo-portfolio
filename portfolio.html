         Web developers create functional, user-friendly websites and web applications. They may write code, develop and test new applications, or monitor site performance and traffic. Front-end developers focus on the user-facing side of their work, while back-end developers make websites functional and secure.
         A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer</p>
